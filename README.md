# Calibrate Study Plaform

## Project Description and Objectives

### Description



### Objectives

* Provide a simple, customizable interface for associates to study for panels and weekly assessments
* Deliver approved libraries of review questions to associates
* Allow associates to create and share their own questions and libraries
* Optionally display associates' performance on leaderboards

## Current State

Associates study for assessements and panels using a variety of tools, including 
Q&A spreadsheets provided by the trainer, Quizlet question sets, and review of weekly quizzes. 
There is no official infrastructure for sharing review material which does not require direct 
management by the training or content team. Re-assigning weekly quizzes for associates
to review creates confusion with the scheduled evaluations' results and requires configuration
by the trainer. Question banks cannot be created by associates in response to specific 
client requests or panel topics. 

## Scope

Calibrate will deliver an interface for creating and sharing libraries of questions which 
can be vetted and standardized by trainers, as well as informally created and shared by 
associates. Associates may choose to view or share their performance in a certain topic 
on public leaderboards.
