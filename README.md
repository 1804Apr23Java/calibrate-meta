# Calibrate Study Plaform

## Project Description and Objectives

### Description

Calibrate is a fully featured quiz web application designed for Revature associates to practice for panel and client interviews. Associates can generate and take quizzes composed of questions from vetted public question libraries, as well as their own personalized question libraries. The objective is provide an informal, associate-driven study tool which trainers may moderate as needed. 

### Objectives

* Provide a simple, customizable interface for associates to study for panels and weekly assessments
* Deliver approved libraries of review questions to associates
* Allow associates to create and share their own questions and libraries
* Optionally display associates' performance on leaderboards

## Current State

Associates study for assessements and panels using a variety of tools, including 
Q&A spreadsheets provided by the trainer, Quizlet question sets, and review of weekly Revature Pro quizzes. 
There is no official infrastructure for sharing review material which does not require direct 
management by the training or content team. Re-assigning weekly quizzes for associates
to review creates confusion with the scheduled evaluations' results and requires configuration
by the trainer. Question banks cannot be created by associates in response to specific 
client requests or panel topics. 

## Scope

Calibrate will deliver an interface for creating and sharing libraries of questions which 
can be vetted and standardized by trainers, as well as informally created and shared by 
associates. Associates may choose to view or share their performance in a certain topic 
on public leaderboards. 

### Features 

* Associates can generate and take quizzes composed of questions from admin-verified public question libraries
* Associates can develop their own personalized question libraries and submit them to administrators 
* Administrators (trainers) may approvice submitted libraries and make them public
* Users can generate quizzes from several libraries to allow maximum flexibility in choosing topics they need to study, as well as choose special options to generate quizzes from the hardest questions, or most missed questions
* Associates can review all of their personal quiz attempts to guide their study and anonymously gauge how well they scored on a particular quiz versus other users. 
* Administrators can add or delete user accounts, approve or deny libraries, and modify libraries and questions.
